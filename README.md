- The main challenge is conducting EDA on a loan dataset to identify key variables indicating loan default potential, offering insights for informed loan decisions.

- The company must balance loan approvals to minimize financial loss by identifying high-risk applicants through EDA for effective risk assessment and portfolio management.
